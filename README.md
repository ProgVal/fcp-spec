# fc00 specs

This repository hosts **work-in-progress** specifications
of the fc00 suite of networking protocols.
They're being derived from the reference implementation [cjdns][cjdns].

Note that fc00 is a working title. It's also knows as:
fc00::/8, FC, Futuristic Connectivity.
The public network running cjdns is called Hyperboria.

We invite anyone to take part in the discussion and editing of these specs.
Please take note of the [conduct](code of conduct).
