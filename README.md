# fc00 specs

This repository hosts a **work-in-progress** specification
of the Futuristic Connectivity network.

It's being derived from the reference implementation [cjdns][cjdns].
We decided to name this work differently,
because "cjdns" isn't a useful name.

- [Introduction](intro.md)
- [CryptoAuth](cryptoauth.md)
- [Switch](switch.md)
- Protocols
  - [Pathfinder](protocols/pathfinder.md)
  - [IPv6](protocols/ipv6.md)
  - [IPTunnel](protocols/iptunnel.md)
- Transports
  - [Ethernet](transports/ethernet.md)

Find us in #fc00 on freenode IRC.

We invite anyone to take part in the discussion and editing of these specs.
Please take note of the behaviour we practice and expect: [conduct](code of conduct)
